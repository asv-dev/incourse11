<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a monorepo which contains all code from all our lessons.
I've decided to store everything in 1 place in order to:

* You to have easy access to all historical data 
* There is a live version stored on github, so you can check the result from every lesson by the link above
* You will have experience on working with the repository which is constantly updating
